Scenario: A system logs file system events. Write a program to count the number of times the word ERROR appears.

Algorithm:

1. Open system.log in read mode.

2. Initialize counter to zero.

3. For each line, if "ERROR" appears in the line, increment counter.

4. Close the file.

5. Display total ERROR messages.

output:

total ERROR messages :2
